# Simon Game
The Simon Game is a classic memory game in which players are required to memorize and repeat a sequence of colors or sounds. This particular version of the game is a web-based implementation that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Gameplay
To start the game, the player must press any key on their keyboard. The game will then display a sequence of colors, which the player must memorize and then repeat by pressing the corresponding keys in the correct order. Each time the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game will add an additional color to the sequence, making it progressively more challenging.

If the player presses the wrong key at any point in the game, the game ends and the player must start again. The game keeps track of the player's high score, which is the longest sequence of colors that the player was able to successfully repeat.

## Technologies Used
The Simon Game was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS are responsible for creating the game's user interface, while the JavaScript is responsible for the game's logic and functionality.
